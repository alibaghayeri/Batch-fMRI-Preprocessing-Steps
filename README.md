### Batch Preprocessing Steps
This repository contains one main file for batch preprocessing of fMRI data. There is also a PDF file in which all preprocessing steps are explained.

### Data
All preprocessing steps were performed on data taken from the [Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) public database](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/).
The acquisition was performed using a 3T Philips MRI scanner. The specific scanning parameters of the experimental data (EPI data) included TR=3000 ms and TE=30 ms, flip angle 80.0 degree, imaging matrix of 64 * 64 with voxel size 3.3 mm * 3.3 mm * 3.3 mm and 48 slices. Also the volume of each time series was 140.
The parameters of the MPRAGE (3D T1W) image included TR=6.8 ms and TE=3.1 ms, flip angle 9.0 degree, imaging matrix of 256 * 256 * 170, voxel size of 1.0 mm * 1.0 mm * 1.2 mm. 



### ADNI policy
ADNI data cannot be publicly shared by private users. It was not possible to directly upload data in this repository. However, feel free to [contact me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ali-baghayeri-a43aa916a?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_contact_details%3BoIplDrggQ62S%2FHTgnq47lw%3D%3D) if you need more information about how to access data.

Remember to follow the [ADNI data sharing and publication policy](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/wp-content/uploads/how_to_apply/ADNI_DSP_Policy.pdf), if you are going to publish a work in which data from the ADNI database were used.
